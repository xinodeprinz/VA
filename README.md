Video Africa is a video network for Africa currently based in Uganda, where individuals and companies pay users to watch their videos. In order for you to be able to watch a video, you'll need to invest any amount of money of your choice in the range 250 FCFA to 1,000,000 FCFA. This money is used as taxes to settle the Ugandan government and the payment gateways (MTN and Orange).

Once you've invested, you'll be given 1 video daily to watch after which you'll be paid once the video has been watched completely. The number of days and the amount paid per video depends on the amount you invest. Earning days range from 2 to 30 days.

Our payment methods are MTN and Orange, and we work in the following African countries: Uganda,
Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Chad, Congo Republic and Congo Democratic. Withdrawal is pretty easy! Once you've reached an amount greater than or equals to your minimum withdrawal amount, you can then withdraw. Our withdrawal is automatic with 0% charges, and takes less than 1 second to be deposited in your mobile money account.
